### dimple ###

An object-oriented API allowing you to create flexible axis-based charts using [d3.js](http://d3js.org "d3.js"). The intention of this project is to allow analysts who are not necessarily expert JavaScript programmers to create standard (and some not-so-standard) business analytics.

The API will also expose the core d3 objects where possible so that as users gain confidence they can extend the base functionality in whatever way they wish.
